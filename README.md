# About
This repository contains Matlab scripts for Benes networks.
- `BenesNet_IO2S.m`: finds switch states of a Benes network, given its output.
- `BenesNet_S2IO.m`: finds output of a Benes networks, given its switch states.
- `benes_test.m`: test script for functionality and speed of `BenesNet_IO2S.m` and `BenesNet_S2IO.m`.

# Notes
- We consider [Benes networks][BN1] that contain only 2-2 switches.
